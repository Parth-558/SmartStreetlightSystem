# 🌃 Smart Streetlight System (Auto + Manual Override)

A smart embedded system that automatically controls a streetlight using an LDR sensor and allows manual override using a pushbutton — simulating real smart city infrastructure.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌞 **Auto Mode**: Uses LDR to detect darkness and turn streetlight (LED) ON/OFF
- ✋ **Manual Mode**: Toggle LED ON/OFF manually using a pushbutton
- 🔁 **Mode Switching**: Pressing the button toggles between Auto ↔ Manual Mode
- 🔧 Built with Arduino UNO, easy to simulate on Tinkercad

## 💡 Code Logic

- LDR reads light levels via analog input (A0)
- In Auto Mode:  
  - LDR < 500 → LED ON  
  - LDR ≥ 500 → LED OFF
- In Manual Mode:  
  - Button toggles LED ON/OFF (ignores LDR)
- Every 3rd press → returns to Auto Mode
